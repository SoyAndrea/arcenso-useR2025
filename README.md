## Quarto theme

This Quarto theme was designed and developed by [Ariana Bardauil](https://github.com/ariibard) specifically for this presentation. Its use is possible thanks to her permission, as it is not publicly available at this time.
I am grateful to Ariana for her creativity and dedication in designing this theme, which brings a unique visual identity to the project.
