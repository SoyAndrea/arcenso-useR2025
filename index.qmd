## Hi {.arg-title1}

## ARcenso{.smaller .arg-title2}
<br>

Supported by the rOpenSci Champions Program cohort 2023-2024^[[Introducing rOpenSci Champions - Cohort 2023-2024](https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/02/15/champions-program-champions-2024/)], this project is led by lead developer Andrea G√≥mez Vargas, co-developer Emanuel Ciardullo, and mentor Luis D. Verde.

It is a citizen-driven initiative that emerged from our professional experience working with census data at the National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina (INDEC).

## Project Overview {.arg-title3 .smaller}

<br>


**Develop an R data package that makes available the official national population census data of Argentina**, produced by the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC), covering the period from 1970 to 2022. The data are homogenized, organized, and ready to use. The package provides open access to these datasets, facilitating their use by the public, researchers, and decision-makers.


## Problem Statement {.arg-title4 .smaller}

<br>

Historical census results for **1970, 1980, 1991, 2001, 2010 and 2022** in Argentina are available in different formats through physical books, PDFs, excel files, and REDATAM outputs, without having a unified system or format that would allow working with the data from these six census periods as a database.

This fragmentation limits data accessibility, interoperability, and reuse, especially for users working within the R environment.

## Proposed Solution {.arg-title5}

> From excel tables to **ordered tables** in R

# Conceptual framework {.arg-title6}

## FAIR Principles{.smaller .arg-title5}

**Findable:**

Centralized census data covering six national census periods (1970‚Äì2022), openly published in a single R data package with clear versioning.

**Accessible:**

Publicly available, homogenized census datasets provided in open formats and accompanied by comprehensive documentation and metadata.

**Interoperable:**

Tidy, well-structured tables that enable easy integration with other demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic datasets within the R ecosystem.

**Reusable:**

Includes detailed variable descriptions, standardized coding across census years, open licensing, and reproducible data structures that facilitate long-term use and cross-study comparisons.

- **Derived-core:** Calculated variables  
  (e.g., fertility rates)
- **Additional:** Country-specific topics  
  (e.g., religion)

- **Download:** Automated web scraping to collect census tables from official sources.

- **Select:** Listed, classified, and extracted relevant files and metadata (census year, geography, topics).

- **Transform:** Converted Excel tables into tidy, standardized datasets using base R.

- **Function development:** Built R functions to access, manipulate, and visualize the data efficiently.

- **Package creation:** Integrated datasets and functions into the ARcenso package for easy use and reproducibility.

- **Version control:** Used Git and GitHub for tracking changes, collaboration, and release management.
