Hi everyone, and thank you for being here.
In this talk, I’d like to share the story behind ARcenso 

But first, let me introduce myself.
I’m Andrea, a sociologist from Argentina. I learned R through the R community, and thanks to that support, I now work as a Population Statistics Analyst at INDEC — our national statistics office.

It was through this experience that the idea for ARcenso emerged.  And I had the chance to turn that idea into a real, useful tool thanks to the rOpenSci Champions program.

## Why is census data important?{.arg-title91}

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="3%"}

:::

::: {.column width="97%"}


- Helps understand the population's characteristics and needs.

- Is essential for designing effective public policies (social, economic, and territorial planning).

- Serves as a vital component of academic, social, and market research.

- Forms the foundation for evidence-based decision-making.

::: {.notes}

Before I talk about the package, I want to briefly highlight why census data matters — anywhere in the world.

These datasets are essential for understanding the population and are the foundation for designing public policies and planning social, economic, and political development.

We all use census data: researchers, government officials and citizens alike.

## The 2022 Census Operation{.arg-title91}

<br>

::: {.columns}


::: {.column width="10%"}

:::

::: {.column width="90%"}
Argentina conducted its national census in 2022, the country's largest statistical operation. Starting in 2023, we began publishing the final results, to which I contributed.

In addition to presenting the data, we had to edit and generate hundreds of Excel tables using R, which was a very manual process.
:::

:::


::: {.notes}

Argentina conducted its national population census in 2022.

During 2023 and 2024, official reports with the results were released.

But beyond those publications, we had a tedious and manual task: preparing hundreds of Excel tables to present specific information for different themes.


:::

##  An idea in the middle of chaos{.arg-title91}

::: {.columns}


::: {.column width="30%"}
<br>

![](images/fine.png)

:::

::: {.column width="70%"}

We had to make many Excel tables. We didn't know if they were useful or even usable. During that process, I thought **this should be a package in R**, but the idea remained up in the air until rOpenSci Champions appeared and took shape.

:::

:::


::: {.notes}

We had to put together hundreds of spreadsheets, which was a huge manual task, without knowing if anyone was actually using them. that's when i thought: this should be a package in r.  this idea stayed there until i saw the call for ropensci champions program.

::: {.notes}

The rOpenSci Champions programme encourages leadership in open science and free software through mentoring and peer support, particularly for individuals from historically underrepresented groups. While financial recognition is included, it was the community that made the biggest difference for me. I almost didn't apply because I doubted whether I was good enough. Then the R-Ladies remind me that I could do it, that I already had what it took and that the programme would help me to grow even more.

## What was (is) my project?  {.arg-title5}

<br>


**Develop an R data package that makes available the official national population census data of Argentina**, produced by the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC), covering the period from 1970 to 2022. The data are homogenized, organized, and ready to use. The package provides open access to these datasets, facilitating their use by the public, researchers, and decision-makers.



::: {.notes}
The original idea behind the project was to create a package that would make available the official data of the national population censuses in Argentina from INDEC from nineteen seventy to twenty twenty-two (1970 to 2022), “ho-MO-dja-naizd / OR-ga-naizd / and RE-di tu yus” homogenized, ordered and ready to use.
:::



## Why? {.arg-title5}

<br>

Historical census results for **1970, 1980, 1991, 2001, 2010 and 2022** in Argentina are available in different formats through physical books, PDFs, excel files, and REDATAM outputs, without having a unified system or format that would allow working with the data from these six census periods as a database.

This fragmentation limits data accessibility, interoperability, and reuse, especially for users working within the R environment.


::: {.notes}

Until now, the data from the six censuses were in different formats: books, PDFs, Excel spreadsheets, and REDATAM. This made it nearly impossible to analyze them together or in a series.

REDATAM is a software developed by CEPAL (ECLAC) to process and analyze detailed census and survey microdata for small geographic areas. It supports the UN’s mission to improve data accessibility and statistical capacity in Latin America and the Caribbean.

##  The proposal {.arg-title5}

> From excel tables to **ordered tables** in R

The proposal was to transform those scattered spreadsheets into tidy tables. Where before there was chaos, now there is reproducible structure.

::: {.notes}

So, how did we start? Once we got a better sense of the topic, we had to figure out how to organize the data from six censuses into a package—and survive the process!

:::

## Conceptual Framework: UN Census Data Structure {.smaller .arg-title5}

<br>

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
#### Census Topics
- **Core:** Essential variables  
  (e.g., age, sex, population)
- **Derived-core:** Calculated variables  
  (e.g., fertility rates)
- **Additional:** Country-specific topics  
  (e.g., religion)
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
#### Conceptual Units
- **Population:** Individuals
- **Housing:** Physical dwellings
- **Household:** People sharing a dwelling
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
#### Geographic Coverage
- **National level**
- **Jurisdictional level**
:::

:::


::: {.notes}
We organized the information according to the United Nations' Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses. 

This conceptual framework enabled us to structure the data according to units of analysis, as well as classify the variables and geographic disaggregation.

:::



## Conceptual Framework: FAIR Principles {.smaller .arg-title5}

<br>

<div style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6; max-width: 800px; margin: auto;">
  <p><strong>Findable →</strong> Six national censuses (1970–2022) in one R package, clearly versioned.</p>
  <p><strong>Accessible →</strong> Open, homogenized datasets with docs & metadata.</p>
  <p><strong>Interoperable →</strong> Tidy tables ready to integrate with other R data.</p>
  <p><strong>Reusable →</strong> Standardized codes, open license, reproducible structures.</p>
</div>

::: {.notes}

FAIR principles were employed to ensure the tables' usability. The data is now findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable [“The DÉI-ta is NAU FAIN-da-bol, ak-SÉ-sa-bol, in-ter-Ó-pe-ra-bol, and ri-IÚ-sa-bol.”]. This package has a structure, documentation, open licensing, and is easily integrated into any R ecosystem analysis

::: {.notes}

Along the way, as we reviewed the earliest census years, we discovered that each Excel file had a different design—some more complex than others—which made automating the creation of tables and combining all the census years into one dataset quite challenging.

At first, I laughed about it, but soon I wanted to cry—one year had 300 files, the next 800, and I still had so much more ahead

## From Excel Storms to a Clear Path{.tabla-chica .arg-title5}


| Stage | Census years      | Geographic level               | 
|-------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1     | 1970              | National and 24 jurisdictions  | 
|       | 1980              | National level                 | 
| 2     | 1991 and 2001     | National level                 |                                        
| 3     | 2010              | National level                 |                                        
| 4     | 2022              | National level                 |                                        
| 5     | 1980 and 1991     | 24 jurisdictions               |                                        
| 6     | 2001 and 2010     | 24 jurisdictions               |                                        
| 7     | 2022              | 24 jurisdictions               |   


::: {.notes}

So, in the middle of the crisis, we decided to create a roadmap for data availability. This way, we could work on the package in parallel while having part of the data ready to test it, gradually making more information accessible over time. We are now in Stage 1 of data availability.

- **Download:** Automated web scraping to collect census tables from official sources.

- **Select:** Listed, classified, and extracted relevant files and metadata (census year, geography, topics).

- **Transform:** Converted Excel tables into tidy, standardized datasets using base R.

- **Function development:** Built R functions to access, manipulate, and visualize the data efficiently.

- **Package creation:** Integrated datasets and functions into the ARcenso package for easy use and reproducibility.

- **Version control:** Used Git and GitHub for tracking changes, collaboration, and release management.
 
:::

::: 


::: {.notes}

so we had to design a multi-stage process: scraping, manual selection, cleaning with R, function development, and all versioned on GitHub. The most important thing was to maintain consistency between censuses and make it easy to use with simple functions

## The People Behind ARcenso  {.arg-title8}

With the support of the rOpenSci Champions Program, cohort 2023–2024, this project is led by Andrea Gómez Vargas, main developer, alongside Emanuel Ciardullo as co-developer and Luis D. Verde as mentor. Tamara Derner designed the project hex logo, and Ariana Bardauil created the Quarto slide theme.


![](images/team.png)

::: {.notes}

I led this project, working closely with Emanuel Ciardullo, a statistician and co-author. Together, we formed a strong team to ensure the best statistical experience possible within the package. Luis D. Verde, our mentor, supported us throughout the technical challenges and development, bringing valuable guidance despite our different professional backgrounds.

On the design side, a friend who is a designer created the project’s hex logo—I had to explain to her the importance of hexagons in the community and that this was an R package. Ariana Bardauil specially crafted the Quarto theme for our presentation. These talented individuals helped give ARcenso its identity, and I’m always grateful for their contributions.

:::


## The R Community Powering ARcenso {.arg-title8}

![](images/comunidades.png)


> Behind every open-source tool, there’s a community lifting each other up.

::: {.notes}

Behind ARcenso is the power of the R community—an open-source ecosystem where collaboration and mutual support bring projects like this to life. ARcenso has been empowered by the community in many ways, but at its core, the community is made up of people who believe in collaborative learning and sharing knowledge.

:::

## A Shared Tool, A Growing Community {.arg-title8}

<br>


ARcenso has been presented at **local R chapters**, **universities**, and **regional conferences**.  

<br>

 > What began as a personal need became a shared resource.



::: {.notes}

ARCENSO It has been presented in various places across the country and throughout the continent.

## From User to Developer {.arg-title8}

![](images/todo.png)


I started out searching for solutions. 

I ended up building one.


::: {.notes}

And the final, and most powerful message: From User to Developer.

When I first approached the community, I didn’t know anything about R. It took years to understand how it could help me in my work. And just when I thought I couldn’t create packages, an opportunity came along—and I did it.

So, if you have a plan for your work or just want to explore and have fun, remember that the community will always be there to support you, to tell you that you can do it, and that you have to believe in yourself.
